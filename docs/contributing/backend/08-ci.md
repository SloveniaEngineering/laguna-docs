# CI Workflow

To skip CI for a commit, add [One of the these keywords to your commit message](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs).
Only do this if you are resolving `T-Stupid` issue/PR.

If you add any of  the following labels to your issue/PR they will be added to Laguna MoSCoW:

* `T-Tracker`
* `M-Archived`
* `S-Must`
* `S-Should`
* `S-Could`
* `S-Wont`

:::info
Because we don't have automatic sorting based on labels, anything marked with labels above is put into `No Status` column and must be manually moved to correct column.
