# Requirements

1. Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
3. Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

:::tip
It is recommended to run Linux (either WSL or VM if you are not on Linux) for development.
This is because `scripts/*` are written in bash and because backend will be deployed on linux.
